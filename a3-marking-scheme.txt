      Well done! I wish you a happy winter holiday period!

Functionality/Design  [33/39]

(a) Signaling system: 9/9
1   [/1] - set up default behaviour
1   [/1] - syskill implementation  
1   [/1] - syssighandler implementation
1   [/1] - sigreturn 
2   [/2] - building of stack - prioritizing signals - blocking out
1   [/1] - handles kill to sleeping process
1   [/1] - handles kill to a read process doing a read
1   [/1] - trampoline setup/code

read aborts on signal.


(b) Keyboard: 
   DII: [6/6]
1   [/1] - Device table
1   [/1] - FD in PCB
1   [/1] - DII open hunting down FD etc 
1   [/1] - DII close - returning FD slot for use
1   [/1] - DII read 
1   [/1] - DII write

  IOCTL needs for the echo 
    Keyboard specific [7/9]
1   [/1] - open - 1 keyboard mode 
0   [/1] - close - cleans up and allows keyboard to be reused
1   [/1] - write - should be failure
1   [/1] - read handles buffer filling
1   [/1] - read on empty buffer
0   [/1] - read returns upon carriage return 
1   [/1] - handles EOF properly
1   [/1] - uses interrupts 
1   [/1] - can produce capital letters

close doesn't disable interrupts. pending read isn't cleaned up on close(). which could happen in a signal handler.

if there is a \n in the buffer already when read() is called. it waits
for more data.



(c) Test
    Init program [6/6]
1      [/1] Prints banner 
1      [/1] Handles prompt for username and echoes username
1      [/1] Handles prompt for password and does not echo
1      [/1] Only logs in if valid username/password
1      [/1] Launches shell, if logged in
1      [/1] Reprompts

   Shell program [5/9]
1      [/1] - buitlin command ps
0      [/1] - builtin command ex
1      [/1] - builtin command k
0      [/1] - a - alarm command 
1      [/1] - starts the t process
0      [/1] - interrupt of a read by a signal
0      [/1] - handles the &
1     [/1] - handles unsupported commands
1     [/1] - if no & waits for process to end before reprompting

Ex should go back to login prompt
t & not working. t& seems to work.
& only recognized with "a&" but missing parameter.

Test Cases: 1 points each total of [8/9]. 

The output was to handed in, in a file named testdoc.txt. For the 1
mark each test must be appropriately delineated and identified. There
needs to be a description of what the test is supposed to show and
what it does (0.5 mark). There should be test output and
interpretation of the results (0.5 mark). The tests do not have to be
passed. The 9 test cases are as follows:


[1/1] 1. Test showing prioritization of signals
[1/1] 2. syssighandler() test case
syskill
[0/1] 3. syssigwait() test case
[1 /1] 4. sysopen() with invalid arguments
[1 /1] 5. syswrite() with an invalid file file descriptor
[1 /1] 6. sysioctl() test for invalid commands
[1 /1] 7. sysread() when there are more characters buffered in 
   kernel than the read requests
[2 /2] 8. Two test cases for scenarios not covered here or in the test program.

Readability 

   Criteria:

      3 marks - Code is "clean", understandable and well organized,

      variable naming

      0  Marks there are major problems across multiple categories

Description of the expectations with respect to the broad marking
criteria


READABILITY 
   It is important that your code is readable not only when you write
   but at some later time and it also needs to be readable by a
   knowledgeable third (i.e. a TA, someone else in the class :-). In
   essence a knowledgeable third party would be someone capable of
   reading the code and be broadly familiar with a typical solution
   approach but might not be familiar with the subtle nuances of the
   algorithm you have developed/used and how it manifests itself in
   the code. To make your code readable it is important to consider
   the following sorts of things:

   * Make sure to use indention in a consistent fashion. In particular
     make sure that you don't use tabs as just how they are displayed
     depends upon a lot of things. You might have your tabs set to be
     2 spaces while someone else might have it set at 8 spaces or vary
     across the line and those differences will affect readability. 

   * Keeps lines to a reasonable link. Many display devices are
     optimized for looking at code that has no more than 80 characters
     on a line. 

   * Use white space (blank lines, spaces) to separate distinct blocks
     of code. Certainly you want blank lines (and some other stuff)
     between functions and within blocks of code in a function that
     perform a related task.

   * Make sure that your variables have meaningful names that suggest
     the type of information the variable holds and is purpose. The
     only exception (sometimes) is if the variable is loop index.

   * Make sure that functions also have meaningful names and are
     organized in a meaningful way. Code used multiple times is to be
     encapsulated into functions. 

Documenting your code:

   Every file provided to you that you need to add substantial content
   to, or any file containing code that you add to the git project is
   to start with a comment describing the purpose of this code from a
   high level perspective. (If the file was not substantially empty
   then add this comments at the point where you started adding your
   code.)  This comment is to contain:
   
   * A list of all the functions/methods that are to be called from
     outside this file. (i.e. functions/methods used only within this
     file are not included.) For each of these functions/methods
     provide a brief description of the function's purpose and what it
     returns, and, if appropriate, how to interpret any values that
     might be returned. For example you might indicate that it returns
     the count of the number of elements in an array or a negative
     value if an error was encountered.

  * The code itself needs to be well commented, but care needs to be
    taken to avoid over commenting and affecting readability. The
    purpose of comments is to assist the reader in understanding what
    the code is supposed to do and **how** it goes about doing it. To
    achieve this make sure that there is a comment before each
    function explaining the purpose of the function, what it expects
    as inputs and produces as outputs. Within the code you should have
    comments explaining the purpose of lines of related code.

  * Any unusual or complex algorithms or strategies for solving a
    problem also need to be documented in the code. In some cases
    these comments can go before the declaration of the function
    whereas in other cases the comment belongs with the relevant
    section of code. To help decide where the comment belongs evaluate
    the comment with respect to its purpose. If it is a general
    description of what you are doing and how then put it before the
    function or maybe even at the start of the file. If it is more
    related to the code then put it with the code. There need to be
    sufficient comments so that one doesn't have to read the code in
    detail to determine what the code is supposed to be doing.


Code Quality

    There are often many poor or inefficient ways to write
    a program to solve a problem and typically only a few good or
    reasonable ways. A good way needs to balance efficiency across the
    dimensions of memory usage to hold the code and/or data, the
    amount of CPU time used by the program, and maintainability. In
    class (or tutorials) we will often discuss certain ways of doing
    something and why. If you deviate from these in any significant
    way it is important to justify these changes.
